# RustySweep
A somewhat faithful to the original winmine minesweeper clone made entirely in rust designed to be run on the CLI. Might add a cursor interface later if I feel like it.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juls0730/RustySweep.git
   ```

2. **Run the Game:**
    ```bash
    cd RustySweep
    cargo run --release
    ```
